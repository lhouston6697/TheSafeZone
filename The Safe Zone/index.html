      About Us

Cause/Mission:
   Our mission is to support the LGBTQ+ community by providing locations of community centers in every state;
      offering links to supportive websites, groups, contacts, and foundations;
      listing information about some different gender identities and sexual orientations;
      and offering support through our own chat bot. We here at The Safe Zone hope to bring those who find themselves
      in the LGBTQ+ community together, and enforce support among the community as well as its allies.
